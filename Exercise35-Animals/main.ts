// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. 
// • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. 
// • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
// You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

var petAnimals = ["cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"];
// using for loop
for (var _i = 0, petAnimals_1 = petAnimals; _i < petAnimals_1.length; _i++) {
    var onePet = petAnimals_1[_i];
    console.log("\tA ".concat(onePet, " would make  a great pet."));
}
// print a message outside for loop
console.log("\tAny of these animals would make a great pet.");
